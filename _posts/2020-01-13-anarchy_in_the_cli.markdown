Here I sit, warm and cozy from the satisfaction of completing my first project from Flatiron. My code is DRY (for the most part), the flow of the application executes as expected, and the GUI has nice little dashes in place to shield the eyes from certain exhasution. 5 days ago, this was absolutely not the case. 

I began my CLI project journey a mere week ago. This was around the time I was balled up in bed with the sheets over my head, like a sleepy-time ghost. At that point, I couldn't for the life of me find a starting point. I knew all of the requirements I had to meet, but it all seemed *so far off*. I summoned the courage to visit a site that listed a host of different public APIs, provided to me by my cohort lead. I wanted to dip my feet into something to get an understanding of what I was about to go through, so I decided on an API that gives weather information based on location. At this point, all I had to do was build a ruby gem that utilized this API, and present it in a reasonable way! Easy enough. It was now that I had realized that I had *no idea* how to build a gem. 

Failure after failure. I would figure out the problem directly in front of me, which would then pass me along to some other, usually more trecherous, problem to deal with. Once I figured out how to build the gem file structure correctly, I would then need to understand the function of each piece of the gem. Then, figure out how each piece of the gem interacted with each other. And so on. And I still haven't written one line of code.

Ironically, these feelings I've described are coming back to me as I type this sentence. I feel like each new idea in this post inevitably leads me to another topic I've not yet discussed. However, we get up and move foward, similar to how I built my project.

I wound up not using the weather API I mentioned above, for the simple reason that I never check the weather. If it rains, I get rained on. It's a silly philosophy, but it's all I know. I chose to use an API that delivered (no pun intended) recipe information from a massive list of meals. 

The first night I would spend reveiwing Flatiron videos and Bundler documentation to get my confidence up and ready to begin tackling this beast. I began understanding the gemspec and gem file, and its role in the gem environment. Then, I would begin tinkering with the API I decided on, and passing test requests using Postwoman. Postwoman is great, because it allows you to pass API requests, and displays the response on the page. This allowed me to know exactly what type of response I would be receiving from the API, and react accordingly in my application.

As my gem grew larger and began coming together conceptually, I felt the confidence and satisfaction that many programmers love to talk about. It was no code-along or lab, it was up to me! I had the discretion to add or remove any functionality per my own creative expression. This was the first time during the course I truly felt like I was using a computer to complete a difficult and *useful* task.

In hindsight, I am happy with how the project unfolded. There were plenty of resources available from Flatiron, but several problems required me to look outside the scope of what our school had to offer. This was a blessing in disguise, as these problems required me to think of a single question that encapsulates the problem (to ask the internet, of course). This seems straightforward; questions are easier asked than answered. This is true, but constructing the question to a specific problem that is not understood yet drove me, technically speaking, bonkers. But I improved on it, like every other problem discussed so far.

I look forward to the next project, and the technical assessment for this one! I've come a long way, and I am proud of the creation I have made.
